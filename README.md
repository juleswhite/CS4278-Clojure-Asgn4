# In-class Programming Quiz

For this in-class programming quiz, you will be working in pairs. Each team needs to produce a simple app that demonstrates
full stack development (covers both client and server development). You can build any app that you want. The requirements
of your app are as follows:

  1. The app must include at least one new handler function on the server-side (e.g., handler.clj) that is integrated
     into the routes.
  2. You must demonstrate the use of extracting data from the URL (path parameters) and from data in the request (query or 
     form data parameters) and passing it to one or more handlers.
  3. You must demonstrate the use of state stored in an atom on the server.
  4. You must build a UI that sends requests to your server-side handler in response to some user event (e.g., clicking).
  5. You must display data in your UI that comes from the server.
